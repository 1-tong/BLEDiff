# 引言

> Performing non-compliance checking in a black-box fashion makes BLEDiff agnostic to the device’s underlying embedded operating systems, peripherals, and programming languages, and thus en-ables it to cover a diverse set of BLE devices with different in-put/output capabilities, many of which were not studied before.

* 方法论
> we use a Finite State Machine (FSM) as the input-output protocol abstraction and use the FSM to identify diverse noncompliant behavior.For automatically extracting the protocol FSM of BLE implementations, BLEDiff relies on an active FSM learning approach.

    * 自动机理论
>In FSM learning, the learner starts from a known initial state, sends a sequence of over-the-air protocol messages (queries) to the device-under-test, and, based on the responses to the queries, infers the FSM of the underlying protocol implementation.  

* 现有论文的缺陷
> active FSM learning often fail to learn security- critical interactions and to complete FSM exploration.

* BLEFiff 采取的方法
> BLEDiff divides the BLE protocol into multiple sub-protocols
> 说白了就是 把 子协议 都分开 进行学习

* 贡献
1. We propose BLEDiff an automated, scalable, property and reference FSM-agnostic noncompliance checking framework that analyzes and uncovers vulnerabilities in BLE implementations based on automata learning and identifying deviant behavior.
2. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to utilize the idea of dividing and conquering the state space to address the scalability of automata learning in FSM extraction.
3. We design a BLE checking module that automatically identifies deviations at higher depths of an FSM compared to the state-of-the-art.
4. 挖到了很多漏洞

finite state machine (M)
6-tuple (S, S0,Ψ, Σ, Λ, Ω)
==》 M=[S, S0,Ψ, Σ, Λ, Ω]
* 数学表示 M(S, S0,Ψ, Σ, Λ, Ω) 1x6阶矩阵
1. S is a finite set of states
2. S0 ∈S is the initial state of the FSM（学习前的初始值）
3. Σ and Λ are the sets of input and output alphabets （这个可以理解为 学习到的 语法树 或者 各状态间的 对应关系 也即 BLE 状态树）


The output of BLEDiff is ∆i which induces the deviant behavior.
